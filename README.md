# Cloud Native Thermostat

This is step by step guide on how to build and maintain cloud native thermostat using Raspberry Pi, K3s on K3os and cheap ESP8266 microchip.

![Raspberry Pi K3os Cluster](./img/Raspberry%20Pi%20K3os%20Cluster.jpeg)

## Why?

Because I hated our bathroom floor heating thermostat and wanted something better and learn new things along the way.

## Why Cloud Native? Isn't it bit overhead?

Running K8s cluster to power simple cron job for triggering heating on and off may seem like overhead ðŸ¥´. But in the another way running such a critical application like home heating on some single Raspberry Pi using undocumented scripts, is not good recipe for happy family life ðŸ’¥. Most importantly Kubernetes is my daily bread and I wanted home project, where I can try new technologies and approaches ðŸ•´

## What

- Manager nodes [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) 4GB
- OS [K3OS](https://github.com/rancher/k3os) build using [picl-k3os-image-generator](https://github.com/elmariofredo/picl-k3os-image-generator)
- Scheduler [K3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s)
- Loadbalancer [Metallb](./Sources/metallb-system)
- Ingress [NGINX Ingress Controller](./Sources/ingress-nginx)
- Monitoring 
  - [Grafana](./Sources/monitoring-system/grafana)
  - [Node exporter](./Sources/monitoring-system/node-exporter)
  - [VictoriaMetrics Operator](./Sources/monitoring-system/victoriametrics)
