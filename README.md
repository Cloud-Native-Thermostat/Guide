# Cloud Native Thermostat

This is step by step guide on how to build and maintain cloud native thermostat using Raspberry Pi, K3s on K3os and cheap ESP8266 microchip.

## Why?

Because I hated our bathroom floor heating thermostat and wanted something better and learn new things along the way.

## Why Cloud Native? Isn't it bit overhead?

Maybe ðŸ˜‰, running K8s cluster to power simple cron job for triggering heating on and off may seem like overhead ðŸ¥´. But in the another way running so critical application like home heating on some single Raspberry Pi using undocumented scripts, is not good recipe for working marriage ðŸ¤£. Most importantly Kubernetes is my daily bread and I wanted home project where I can try new technologies and approaches.

## How does it work?
